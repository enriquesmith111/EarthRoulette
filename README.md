<strong>Earth Roulette:</strong> Random Destination Picker (React & Serverless Node.js) <br>
This project is a React web application with a serverless Node.js backend designed to help users discover their next travel destination in a fun and spontaneous way.

<strong>Features:</strong>

<strong>Random Country Selection:</strong> Users spin the roulette to be surprised by a random country or territory from a list of over 250 different regions. <br>
<strong>Immersive Experience:</strong> A beautiful carousel of images from the Unsplash API showcases the chosen country's landscapes and culture. <br>
<strong>Weather Information:</strong> Provides current and weekly weather forecasts for the capital city, allowing users to pack accordingly. <br>
<strong>OpenAI Insights:</strong> Leveraging the OpenAI API, Earth Roulette generates a descriptive summary of the country, including interesting facts and recommended activities for visitors. <br>
<strong>Seamless Flight Booking:</strong> Integrated with the Skyscanner API, users can easily search and potentially book flights to their chosen destination with just a few clicks. <br>
<strong>Backend (Serverless Node.js):</strong> The serverless Node.js backend acts as a central hub for fetching data from various APIs and packages them into a JSON for the front-end to fetch each time the User spins for a random Country. 
It utilizes serverless functions to handle API requests efficiently and securely. <br>
